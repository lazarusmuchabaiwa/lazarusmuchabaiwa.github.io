								<p>Poor reproductive health among youth and adolescents threatens their future health and economic wellbeing in Zimbabwe amidst a high HIV/AIDS prevalence. This study evaluates the impact of a multi-pronged adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) strategy implemented by government of Zimbabwe between 2010 and 2015 to improve ASRH in terms of the uptake of condoms and HIV testing as well as outcomes in terms of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and HIV prevalence. We combine the difference in difference and propensity score matching methods to analyse repeated Zimbabwe demographic health survey cross-sectional datasets. Young people aged 15–19 years at baseline in 2010, who were exposed for the entire five-year strategy are designated as the treatment group and young adults aged 25–29 at baseline as the control. We find that the ASRH strategy increased HIV testing amongst youth by 36.6 percent, whilst treatment of STIs also increased by 30.4 percent. We also find that the HIV prevalence trajectory was reduced by 0.7 percent. We do not find evidence of impact on condom use and STI prevalence. The findings also suggest that although HIV testing increased for all socio-economic groups that were investigated, the effect was not the same. Lastly, we do not find evidence supporting that more resources translate to better ASRH outcomes. We recommend designing future ASRH strategies in a way that differentiates service delivery for youths in HIV hotspots, rural areas and out of school. We also recommend improving the strategy’s coordination and monitoring, as well as aligning and enforcing government policies that promote sexual and reproductive health rights.</p>

								<p>Zimbabwe and other developing countries struggle to achieve millennium development goals originally set for 2015. To assist health policy making, there was an investigation of how demographic, socioeconomic and cultural factors determine maternal healthcare services use in Zimbabwe. A logistic model for four different maternal healthcare services using data from the 2005/6 Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey was estimated. Secondary education increases the odds of use of maternal health services by at least 2 times at 1 percent level of significance whilst access to information increases the odds by 1.52 at the 5 percent level of significance. Women in urban areas are more likely to give birth at healthcare facilities OR 3.49 compared to their rural counterparts at 1 percent significance level. Women from highest income households are more likely to give birth at health facilities than those from poorest households OR 6.44 at 1 percent level of significance whilst the pattern is consistent for other services as well. Other important determinants are age, education, wealth, polygamy and religious affiliation. Generally, policy makers have to appreciate that these factors affect different maternal health services differently. Consequently, strategies to improve the uptake of maternal healthcare like mass media and health workers, particularly for disadvantaged sections of the population like rural areas and the uneducated, should be targeted at specific components rather than planning umbrella strategies.</p>

								<p>The Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey (ZDHS 2010-11) showed that only 6 percent of the population is covered by health insurance in Zimbabwe. This study investigated the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) as an alternative to pooling risk and financing social protection in Zimbabwe. Willingness to Pay (WTP) for health insurance and socioeconomic data were collected through interviews with 121 household heads selected using a 2-stage sampling procedure on 14 villages in Musana and Domboshava rural areas, a population which is largely unemployed and reliant on subsistence agriculture. A CBHI scheme was established and followed up for 3 years documenting data on visits made, financial contributions from recruited households and their actual health expenditures. Findings indicate that CBHI is generally accepted as a means of health insurance in rural communities. The median willingness to pay for health insurance was $5.43 against monthly expenditures ranging of up to $180. The low WTP is attributable to low incomes as only 3.4 percent of the respondents relied on formal employment. Trust issues, adverse selection, moral hazard, and administration costs were challenges threatening sustainability of CBHI. A financial gap averaging 42% was generally on a downward trend and was closed by the end of the follow-up study as contributions were equivalent to medical expenses. We conclude that CBHI is feasible, has potential for sustainability and should be considered as a springboard for the planned Zimbabwean National Health Insurance.</p>

								<p>Although the Zimbabwean government launched an Adolescent and Youth Sexual and Reproductive Health policy in 2010, HIV prevalence and incidence among youth remains amongst the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Zimbabwean Youths in tertiary education institutions exhibit high-risk sexual behaviours. The study aimed to estimate the risk preference parameters of youths in a tertiary education setting to understand their risky behaviour better using prospect theory. It involved 250 students completing a socioeconomic questionnaire and making a choice from over three series of pairwise lottery questions framed around sexual and reproductive health prevention interventions. The study used bivariate techniques to examine differences in risk-taking behaviour. Ordinary least squares and interval regression techniques determined the socioeconomic determinants of the risk behaviour function. The study established an average risk aversion parameter of 0.7 and a probability weighting parameter of 0.8. The probability weighting parameter implies that the participants were more focused on the outcomes with less concern for their likelihood. The study estimated the loss aversion parameter at 2.26, which indicates the need to reduce loss-framed messages in favour of positively framed awareness campaigns. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that income, prior sexual and reproductive health knowledge and alcoholism were associated with risk and loss aversion. We recommend positive framing of youth sexual and reproductive health awareness campaigns. We also recommend youth economic emancipation to increase economic prospects which in turn improves reference points which changes the viewing of health interventions and outcomes from the loss domain to gain domain.</p>

								<p>Health strategies which consider sex and gender elements have been noted to be cost effective and more successful than those which do not. The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether an observed widening of the sex differential in child mortality in Zimbabwe represents an avoidable and inequitable bias against the male child. Other objectives include examining the sex differentials in child mortality and also to examine determinants of child survival within the proximate determinants framework. The Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey kids recode dataset collected between 2010 and 2011 is analysed using survival analysis and multivariate decomposition techniques. There is evidence of sex differentials in child mortality since 1983 although it only achieves statistical significance between 2005 and 2011. Sex of the child, religious beliefs, birth weight, birth order and birth interval are found influencing child survival. Socioeconomic characteristics and returns from these characteristics have conflicting influences on the sex differential in child mortality. Birth weight consistently contributing towards the reduction of the sex gap in child mortality in urban areas and amongst the rich. The findings appear to suggest that the sex gap, although widened, is hugely equitable since we could not justify that socioeconomic variables play any significant role with the exception of interventions towards higher birth weight.</p>

								<p>Despite funding constraints for treatment programmes in Africa, the costs and economic consequences of routine laboratory monitoring for efficacy and toxicity of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have rarely been evaluated. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in the DART trial (ISRCTN13968779). Adults in Uganda/Zimbabwe starting ART were randomised to clinically-driven monitoring (CDM) or laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM); individual patient data on healthcare resource utilisation and outcomes were valued with primary economic costs and utilities. Total costs of first/second-line ART, routine 12-weekly CD4 and biochemistry/haematology tests, additional diagnostic investigations, clinic visits, concomitant medications and hospitalisations were considered from the public healthcare sector perspective. A Markov model was used to extrapolate costs and benefits 20 years beyond the trial. 3316 (1660LCM;1656CDM) symptomatic, immunosuppressed ART-naive adults (median (IQR) age 37 (32,42); CD4 86 (31,139) cells/mm3) were followed for median 4.9 years. LCM had a mean 0.112 year (41 days) survival benefit at an additional mean cost of $765 [95%CI:685,845], translating into an adjusted incremental cost of $7386 [3277,dominated] per life-year gained and $7793 [4442,39179] per quality-adjusted life year gained. Routine toxicity tests were prominent cost-drivers and had no benefit. With 12-weekly CD4 monitoring from year 2 on ART, low-cost second-line ART, but without toxicity monitoring, CD4 test costs need to fall below $3.78 to become cost-effective (less than 3x per-capita GDP, following WHO benchmarks). CD4 monitoring at current costs as undertaken in DART was not cost-effective in the long-term. There is no rationale for routine toxicity monitoring, which did not affect outcomes and was costly. Even though beneficial, there is little justification for routine 12-weekly CD4 monitoring of ART at current test costs in low-income African countries. CD4 monitoring, restricted to the second year on ART onwards, could be cost-effective with lower cost second-line therapy and development of a cheaper, ideally point-of-care, CD4 test.</p>

								<p>The study seeks to examine stock market wealth effects on private non-durable consumption for Zimbabwean households using quarterly data from 1994(1) to 2008(2). The bounds testing approach to cointegration is employed to test the long run relationship between stock market wealth and consumption. An autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) analysis is implemented to examine the relationship among the variables both in the short-run and the long run. The empirical findings suggest significant wealth effects for Zimbabwe, a developing country. This contradicts the commonly held view that LDCs should have insignificant wealth effect since the financial system is still underdeveloped. The dynamic short run error correction model also shows a speedy convergence to long run equilibrium.</p>

								<p>This research paper seeks to establish how effective to measure manufacturing sector competitiveness from existing literature. The objective of this research study is premised on establishing cause and remedies to gain manufacturing competitiveness. Survey data affecting manufacturing sector competiveness like crime, corruption, finance, technology, firm characteristics, workforce characteristics and trade openness was analysed. A regression of volume of manufacturing index (VMI) against imports, electricity usage, exports, GDP, proportion of GDP to electricity usage and FDI was done. It can be concluded that transaction costs need to be reduced and concentrate on improving exports, proportion of electricity per output and FDI.</p>

								<p>This study examines the validity of the export-led growth hypothesis in the Zimbabwean economy. We use annual time series data for the period 1977 to 2006 in an export augmented aggregate production function framework. Applying the bounds testing (ARDL) approach to cointegration, we investigate whether a long-run relationship exists between exports and non-export GDP. Two models are estimated; the first model is the total exports model while the second model disaggregates exports into primary goods export and manufactured goods exports. Empirical results support the export-led growth hypothesis in Zimbabwe and reveal that a longrun relationship exists between exports and non-export GDP and that the direction of relationship runs from exports to non-export GDP in both the short-run and the long-run. The results also show evidence of productivity-enhancing effects of primary exports while manufactured exports are productivity-limiting in the short-run.</p>

								<p>The study seeks to establish the major causes of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) failure in Zimbabwe. Basing on a case study for Bindura, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation criteria was employed to estimate the change in return on investment function which was used as proxy for SME failure. Data were gathered through formal and informal interviews, questionnaires and focus group discussions with SMEs which were randomly selected from different clusters representing different industries. Results showed that lack of general knowledge on business management, unavailability of credit, import competition and high cost of raw materials are the major causes of SME failure in Zimbabwe.</p>

								<p>The study seeks to assess the role played by market middlemen in smallholder horticultural products markets in Zimbabwe. There are contrasting views regarding the role of these middlemen among both farmers and farmers’ representative bodies. One view maintains that middlemen are unnecessary while the other view contends that they are needed. We carried out this study under a research project HIC1 funded by BUSE2 to provide market information to smallholder horticultural farmers. The study is based mainly on observations, discussions and interviews of various stakeholders in the horticultural markets. Results indicated that middlemen are largely beneficial to most market participants especially farmers. For instance, they carry out a daily assessment of markets which act as a cheap source of information to farmers.

								<p>The study sought to assess the impact of the alternative vertical coordination mechanisms for the development of small scale farmers. Zimbabwean government has put small scale farmers as an important key to fight against poverty, create more wealth through increasing productivity in the agricultural sector. The study used descriptive design, questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 50 small scale farmers. Data was analyzed using the multiple linear regression. The research found that the production of tomatoes under contract was associated with significantly higher incomes compared to those who sold on the spot markets or open marketing. Spot markets, while providing occasional high returns to farmers have in turn high price risks and risk of non-sale of products or loss of quality. Contract price were significantly higher than open market prices, but trading on the later involved extra transaction costs such as transport and accommodation. The main conclusion was that contract production and marketing was more profitable and effective than open marketing. The research recommended that government should facilitate the development of small scale horticulture sector through improving the road networks that link rural and urban areas. Access to capital should be improved, government should provide relevant information so that farmers can use timely information to make production and marketing decisions. Government to rehabilitate the national research institutions and link them with extension service, provide efficient markets and intellectual property rights protection through regulation and enforcement of contracts in the horticultural market to ensure sustainable development of small scale farmers.</p>

								<p>The study sought to assess the role of women in reducing absolute poverty in rural Zimbabwe. Specific objectives were to analyze the nature and characteristics of men and women participating in rural development, to compare production levels under male and female headed households as well as to analyze the role of women in decision making. The Descriptive survey method was used on a population of 300 smallholder households. A sample of 52 households was randomly selected. The data collection instrument was a Formal Household Questionnaire Survey administered through personal interviews. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS). The research found that most of the women were illiterate, their households were large and some were elderly people and their major source of income comes from agricultural activities and informal sector activities and from casual labour. Some of the women got training on crop production from AREX, and training on entrepreneurship through NGOs that were implementing developmental projects in the area. The production levels by the women were low in terms of yield per hectare and area planted. Major products were maize, groundnuts, vegetables, sweet potatoes and tomatoes. Very few women are into agro-processing, major processing was on drying vegetables, sweet potatoes and peanut butter making and most of the processing machines were old. Major challenges for the women include large family size due to the effect of HIV/AIDS, high dependency load, lack of innovative, lack of appropriate training,, financial support, land ownership, low produce and climatic change. The research recommended strong capacity building on the women to instill a commercial orientation that is motivational to move them from a subsistence mentality to a commercial focus through increased production, and for further assistance from both government, NGOs and private sectors, to ensure sustainable development.</p>
    
                                <h3> Examination of socioeconomic disparities in the utilisation of adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health services and outcomes in Zimbabwe 2000-2015 </h3>
								<p>Despite the implementation of the adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) strategy in 2010 in Zimbabwe, the extent to which socioeconomic determinants of ASRH utilisation and outcomes have evolved is not well understood. This study analysed three Zimbabwe Demographic Health Surveys datasets collected among adolescents and youths aged 15 to 24 for the period 2000 to 2015 to assess progress in reducing socioeconomic disparities in ASRH utilisation and outcomes. Data were analysed using logistic regression and concentration indexes. Results showed that wealth status, education, gender, religion, health insurance, and access to ASRH information continue to drive differences in the utilisation of ASRH service such as HIV testing, STI treatment and use of contraceptives. An equity lens through concentration indexes showed that differences in ASRH service utilisation and outcomes associated with education, gender, poverty, and rural residence can be classified as inequitable. Success was observed in the declining education gap in condom utilisation and early childbearing. Furthermore, a disproportionately higher HIV infection among females declined by almost half between over the study period. The study recommends the design of future ASRH policies to consider differentiated service provision to cater for education, gender and residential location barriers characteristic of the current health system. The study also recommends further investment in peer educators and community health workers, as well as investment in electronic technology for ASRH education and diagnosis.</p>
                                    
                                <h3>Effects of early childbearing among Zimbabwean women. Under Review at Emerald Journal of Health Research (Under Review)</h3>

								<p>The purpose of this study was to show the long-term health and economic outcomes of early childbearing among women in Zimbabwe. This cross-sectional study analysed data from 6,254 women from the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey. Long-term health and economic outcomes of women who gave birth before the age of 18 versus women who had first birth after the age of 18 were analysed using propensity score matching and structural equation modelling to control for self-selection. The study found that early childbirth reduces education attainment by between 1.4 to 1.8 years and reduces chances of a better occupation by range 8.4% to 9.6%. The reduction of the years of education were larger in older cohorts. HIV prevalence amongst women of early childbearing was 5.1% higher among the cohort aged 20-29 years. In the older cohort aged 40-49 years, the chances of escaping poverty were lower by between 17.3% to 25.5% while chances of owning a property were lower by range 1.87%-5.8%. Recommendations to policymakers include reforming education and health policies to allow and scale up the provision of contraceptives in schools, and economic support to early child bearers. The study showed that propensity score matching and structural equation modelling produce results similar to instrumental variable techniques. It also showed that the effects of early childbearing in largely informal economies are similar to formal sector dominated economies. Lastly the study showed the effects of early childbearing on property ownership and occupation overlooked in previous studies.
